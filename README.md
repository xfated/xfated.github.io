## Gym Equipment Classifier
When the thought of losing weight and getting in shape presents itself, a common go-to place that many think of is the local gym. However, these new gym-goers who enter the place for the first time face a very similar experience. Their untrained eyes breeze past a sea of foreign objects as they head towards the only equipment they know: dumbbells and treadmills. 
The occasional motivation to try out new machines might surface, only to be quickly brushed aside by the intimidating looks of massive bulking beasts or nonchalant individuals with their earpieces plugged in. 

If only there was an easier way to make sense of these complicated machinery and learn how to use them...

## Description
This project explores the use of transfer learning to create a classifier for images of gym equipment and deploying it on a web page.
